# SNEK
## An ASCII Game by AniMerrill Productions

http://www.animerrill.com

### Synopsis

This is a clone of the famous (or perhaps infamous) game Snake created in the Godot Engine. Going against the design conventions of the Godot Engine, the game only uses a single scene with a single node and script. It was mostly done as a challenge to myself to make a game in four hours and I basically succeeded beyond some cleanup work I will be getting to shortly (including some more ASCII art and having it save a high score between sessions).

### Builds

Coming soon!...
